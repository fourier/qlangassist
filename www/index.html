    <p><b>QLangAssist</b> is a simple utility which helps you to learn new words while studying foreign language. It provides you with a window with multiple choices of translation for a particular word. When you have finished your testing it presents you with a dialog with a list of mistakes you've made during the test.</p>
    You should create a custom dictionary in your favorite plain text editor before using the program. <font color=red><i>Use the UTF-8 encoding for the dictionary file!</i></font><br/>
    The dictionary format is quite simple:
    <table bgcolor=lightgrey>
      <tr><td>Word --- Translation</td></tr>
      <tr><td>abrogate --- объявлять недействительным</td></tr>
      <tr><td>fåtölj --- armchair</td></tr>
      <tr><td># comments start with hash character and not used in dictionary</td></tr>
      <tr><td>...</td></tr>
    </table>

		<h2>Downloads</h2>
		<ol>
      <li><a href="downloads/qlangassist-0.1.zip">QLangAsssit for Windows, version 0.1</a>
		</ol>				
		
		<h2>Changes</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Version 0.1 created
		</ul>

		<h2>How to use</h2>
    Once you've prepared a dictionary, you can run the application. <br/>Every time the application starts it will ask you to choose the dictionary file; you may switch to another file during the application's runtime. <br/>The 'Close' [x] button hides the application to the system tray; you may show the window again by double-clicking to the application icon in system tray.
    
		<h2>TODO</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a simple editor to manage user's dictionaries
      <li>Make a possibility to switch the words <-> translations
      <li>Add support for 'cheating' - find the word's translation instantly, not after the test
		</ul>
